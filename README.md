I used **java** language for all  30 programs.
This assignment contains **30 Java programs**, each designed to help me understand the basic structure and logic of the Java programming language.
Through these programs, I practice important concepts such as variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions and classes.
This assignment strengthens my coding skills and builds a strong foundation for advanced programming in the future.
